#### Solution

We first gather the observed means and the point estimates of the $\alpha$ parameters, the hierarchical means of the schools.

```{r}

## Use aggregate to compute the observed mean math score per school
observed.means = aggregate(math ~ school, data = data1, mean)

## Compute the posterior means of the alpha parameters
## to use as point estimates
alphas = samples[[1]][,1:160]
alpha.est = colMeans(alphas)

```

We can now plot the two estimates against one another.

```{r tidy = FALSE}
plot(observed.means$math, alpha.est, 
     ylab = "Hierarchical estimate", 
     xlab = "Observed school mean", 
     col = rgb(0,0,0,.3), pch = 19)
abline(0,1, lty = 2, col="red")

```

Notice the moderate hierarchical shrinkage.
